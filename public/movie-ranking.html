<h1>The Best Movies According to Aadarsh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Hera Pheri</h3>
<p>This movie is one of my favorite movies because it's a comedy movie and the acting is of top class which makes the viewer relate themselves with the movie. Best of all time Ig</p>
<h3>Gangs of Wasseypur</h3>
<p>The theme of this movie is about the Gangsters of local areas. The whole movie is kinda raw which makes it even more interesting.</p>
<h3>Batman(All 3 series)</h3>
<p>I liked concept of how a normal person with only his raw skill and some equipment becomes a hero but never reveals his identity before everyone.</p>
